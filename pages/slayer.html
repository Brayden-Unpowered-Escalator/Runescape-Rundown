        Slayer is a skill that assigns Task's to adventurers who are tasked with eliminating large numbers of monsters and other problems across the world of Gielinor.
        <br><br>
        Masters of Slayer will assign you and other adventurers various 'Slayer Tasks' in all different manners of areas, from dark and dank caves to active volcanoes.<br>
        From lost crypts to uncovered cities. It could be anything on four legs, perhaps a

        Regardless, if a Master has deemed them a task worth taking care of you will be tasked to see it through.
    <br><br>
    From Rats and Goblins and bears a Such.
    <br>
    To Dragons and Demons and Spectres with their foul Touch.
    <br><br>
        If you have a problem that can't be handled by conventional handymen, there is a high likelihood a Slayer can take care of that for you.

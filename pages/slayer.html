    <p>Slayer is a skill that allows players to kill monsters that may otherwise be untargetable by players (players would be prompted with a message stating they do not possess the required Slayer level to attack the monster). Players must visit a Slayer Master, who will assign them a task to kill certain monsters based on the player's Combat level. Slayer experience is awarded each time the player kills an assigned monster, and is equal to the monster's Hitpoints multiplied by its experience bonus.
    <br>
    Many players primarily train Combat by completing Slayer tasks, as Combat experience is still given as normal while fighting Slayer monsters. At higher levels, Slayer becomes more profitable, as higher-leveled slayer monsters tend to have more lucrative drops both in common and uniques. Some bosses are additionally unique to Slayer and can only be killed when assigned it or their lesser category as an assignment.
    <br>
    After completing a set amount of tasks, players will begin to earn slayer reward points, which can be used for a wide array of purposes, such as beneficial buffs on specific tasks or some cosmetics.</p>

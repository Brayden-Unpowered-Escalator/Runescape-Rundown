    Perhaps you need a Mirror Shield to help fend off the gaze of a Basilisk
    <br>or<br>
    A Leaf Bladed Spear that will rend the flesh of the creatures known only as Turoth.
    <br>or<br>
    A Face Mask for your face so the whipping sands of a Dust Devil don't choke you out before you have a chance to even fight.

    Slayer is a skill that assigns Task's to adventurers who are tasked with eliminating large numbers of monsters and other problems across the world of Gielinor.
    <br><br>
    Masters of Slayer will assign you and other adventurers various 'Slayer Tasks' in all different manners of areas, from dark and dank caves to active volcanoes.<br>
    From lost crypts to uncovered cities. It could be anything on four legs, perhaps a 
            <h4><div id="hidden"><a href="https://regulationpigeon.com/"
            target="_blank">small bird</a>
            </div></h4> 
    or even a dragon, or maybe it is on two legs and looks just like you and I.<br>

    Regardless, if a Master has deemed them a task worth taking care of you will be tasked to see it through.
  <br>
    If you have a problem that can't be handled by conventional handymen, there is a high likelihood a Slayer can take care of that for you.
